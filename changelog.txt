-------------- Bunnyhop timer by blacky ---------------2.0 Changes (Not yet available):
- The new timer is now only being made available to KawaiiClan due to the leaking of previous versions.
- Added CS:GO Compatibility.
- The code has been converted to the new SourceMod transitional syntax.
- Made a button plugin that can be used to spawn buttons that start or end timers, tie buttons to start or end timers, or disable buttons that come with the map that start or end timers. (Currently broken)
- Made a more suitable checkpoints plugin for climb servers.
- Made it so every single freestyle zone can have its own unique settings for each style.
- The required admin flags for every admin related feature in the timer can be changed in a config.
- Several admin features can be accessed through the !admin menu.
- Players can change several more settings, and all of it will be in a menu opened with the !settings command.
- Made a plugin that can save your location/timer when you go to spectate or disconnect from the server. (WIP)
- Complete remake of the ranking system. Ranks will recalculate live and there is a tier system in order to better calculate the points players will receive.
- Slight changes to the CSS UI.
- Recoded the replay bots. Only one bot to save player slots. Type !replay to watch a record. Replay bots save much faster now thanks to Mev.
- Changed how the chat rank system works. You can have multiple chat ranks depending on the server's config and any chat rank can award custom chat privileges if specified in the config. Type !chatrank to see all ranks you have.
- Added the !rr (Recent Records) command. It let's you see the most recent records on the server and it has advanced filtering options.
- Added the overtake system so if you have lost any records since you were last connected to the server it should notify you when you join. (WIP)
- Styles can have different airacceleration settings thanks to Mehis.
- Created backwards style.
- There is currently no !stats page and you can't view the record info when selecting a time in the !wr menu. It's on my todo list to get these and much better than older versions.
- Created a Tool Assisted Speedrun (TAS) mode. It can be used on any style allowed in the style config. Times are recorded separately and no points are rewarded for TAS times. Type !tas to use it.
